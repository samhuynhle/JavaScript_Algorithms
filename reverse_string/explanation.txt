Reverse String:

The problem is not difficult, but can be used to really
teach both iteration and recursion.

Trick is to modify in space (mutate the string) for
a O(1) space.

Using a left and right pointer, we can treat the
string as an array and swap the values at each step.

After we swap at each step, we converge the two pointers.

We stop the recursion or while loop when the left pointer
is at a point that it is equal to or greater than the
right pointer.

The run time is O(N). We visit each item at least once.
