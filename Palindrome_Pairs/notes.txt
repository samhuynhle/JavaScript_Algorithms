Approach 1: Brute Force

    Note: This is for reference and you should understand how the brute force method works.

    Use two nested loops, each loop going through each index in the array.
    We need to check if each pair forms a palindrome or not.
    Simple way to check: store the pairing and comparie it with it's reverse.
    If equal, store their pairs indexes, if not move long.
    Important edge case is where words at i and j are equal (they need to be distinct).

    Complexity Analysis:
        n is number of words, k is length of longest words.
        Time Complexity: O(n^2 * k)
            Each word is visited expotentially and each character is visited as well.
        Space Complexity: O(n*k+n^2)
